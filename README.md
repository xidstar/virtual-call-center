# Design Technologist – LLM Workflow Builder

This project is a small React application that implements a visual workflow builder for defining the sequence of questions an LLM agent will ask during insurer phone calls.

The goal of the exercise was to translate a provided Figma design into a functional MVP UI with clear structure, predictable behavior, and clean, readable code.
